# Pulumi Stack Reference

Part of the `Building with Pulumi` pathway.

## Use case
Letâ€™s say you have two systems that depend on one another, perhaps a frontend application with a database and a complex backend API. You might have two separate staging environments that you want to have reference one another. 

You can use stack references to share automatically generated connection strings from the staged API to the staged frontend application to see how they might work together.
